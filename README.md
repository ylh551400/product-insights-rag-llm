#  AI Product Insights System (RAG + LLM)

A fully interactive **AI Product Analyst** that extracts actionable insights from real user reviews using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** + **LLM analytical reasoning**.

Powered by:

* **ChromaDB** semantic search
* **MiniLM-L6-v2** embeddings
* **Claude Sonnet 4** for structured product analysis
* **Streamlit UI** for interactive exploration

This system behaves like a *senior product analyst*—retrieving relevant evidence, synthesizing themes, identifying root causes, and generating recommendations grounded in real user feedback.

---

#  Key Features

### 🔍 **Semantic Retrieval Engine**

* Uses MiniLM embeddings + ChromaDB
* Filters by recency, sentiment, engagement, metadata
* Optimized for **last 12 months** of reviews (keeps insights relevant)

### 🧠 **LLM-Based Product Analysis**

Claude generates structured insights:

* Complaint themes
* Root causes
* Trend shifts
* Product recommendations
* Evidence citations

### 🖥️ **Interactive Streamlit App**

A full UI that lets you:

* Choose analysis type (General / Root Cause / Feature Requests)
* Use built-in **Quick Questions** or type your own
* Inspect the **exact source reviews** used as evidence

👉 **Run the app:**

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The interface supports:

✔ Mode Selection

- General Analysis

- Root Cause Analysis

- Feature Requests

Each mode automatically loads different Quick Questions that match the analysis type.

✔ Ask Your Own Question: type any product question about complaints, matching algorithm issues, pricing, etc.


✔ Evidence Transparency: every insight comes with source review citations so conclusions are always grounded.

Vector database directory (auto-generated):

```
tinder_rag_db_recent/
```

---

#  Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Build the vector database (12-month window)

```bash
python src/build_rag_system_recent.py
```

### Run the interactive Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

---

#  Programmatic Usage

```python
from rag_with_claude import TinderRAGAnalyzer

analyzer = TinderRAGAnalyzer()

analyzer.ask(
    "What are users complaining about recently?",
    filters={"is_negative": True}
)
```

#  Example Insights (Real Output)

## **Q: “Why are users canceling subscriptions or uninstalling?”**

### **Key Drivers**

#### 1. **Billing/Cancellation Failures (critical)**

* Charges continue after cancellation attempts
* Users billed despite deleting/banning accounts
* Cancellation paths missing or broken

#### 2. **Subscription-Triggered Account Bans**

* Users report getting banned immediately after subscribing
* Billing continues even after losing access

#### 3. **Deceptive Pricing Models**

* Weekly billing framed as monthly
* Paid features provide less functionality than free version
* Perception that matching is throttled unless paying

### **Highest-Priority Fixes**

1. Fix cancellation + billing systems
2. Automatically stop billing banned accounts
3. Improve clarity of recurring charges
4. Review ban algorithms for false positives

#  Applicability to Real-World Business (Generalization)

Even though this project uses Tinder reviews,
the architecture generalizes directly to:

## **E-commerce**

* Return/reason clustering
* Pricing sensitivity feedback
* Category-level complaint spikes
* Feature requests for search, checkout, delivery

## **SaaS / Subscription Products**

* Churn reasons
* Onboarding friction
* Paywall frustration
* Feature-gap analysis

## **Customer Support / CX**

* Daily ticket summarization
* Emerging bug identification
* Root cause analysis for escalations

---

## **How this becomes production-ready**

In an enterprise environment:

* Replace CSV ingestion with **API or warehouse pipelines** (Shopify, Amazon, Zendesk, BigQuery)
* Incrementally embed **only new data**
* Append new vectors to the existing DB (no rebuild required)
* Schedule daily/weekly automated analysis via **Airflow/Cron**
* Deliver insights via Slack/Email dashboards

This demonstrates end-to-end product thinking:
**how a prototype insight engine becomes a real operational analytics system.**

#  Skills Demonstrated

* Embedding-based semantic search
* Prompt engineering for analytical reasoning
* Trend detection & theme synthesis
* End-to-end pipeline thinking
